    "This tutorial assumes you have an xml or nml file traced in Knossos (or similar). The file has a list of nodes (x,y,z,radius) that are identified by a node id (int) and a list of edges connecting the nodes. The code can be easily adapted for other generic file types. Knossos is fast, free, lightweight and easy to use. It's available at www.knossostool.org.\n",

    "Depending on how large your skeleton file is, this process could take a few minutes. The goal is a .hoc file, which consists of nodes that make up segments and a connectivity matrix of those segments. A hoc file is handy because the simulator NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu) reads them natively and Ted and I developed toolboxes that work easily with hocs. The flow of the pipeline is as follows:\n",
